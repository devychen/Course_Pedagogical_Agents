### Abstract
The influence of an agent’s emotional state on students’ learning from educational videos
has been a topic of growing interest. Drawing inspiration from the studies conducted by
Lawson et al. (2021) and Beege and Schneider (2023), this paper examines participants’ ability
to accurately perceive various emotions exhibited by a virtual instructor (i.e., an animated
pedagogical agent) during a video lecture introducing ChatGPT. Furthermore, it explores
whether participants’ performance varied depending on the emotional expressions of the agent.
In this study, we recruited 300 participants to test their learning outcomes and evaluation
on agents with four different emotions (two positive and two negative emotions), conveyed
through voices and facial expressions. These emotions are: happy, content, frustrated, and
sad. The results revealed that participants could recognize the emotions expressed by AI
instructors: Happy agents were rated highest for happiness, content agents for contentment,
frustrated agents for frustration, and sad agents for sadness. However, when it came to
learning performance, participants who interacted with agents displaying negative emotions
(frustration and sadness) performed better on tests than those exposed to positive emotions
(happiness and contentment). In terms of subjective experience, participants rated positive
emotion agents as more engaging, expressive, and enjoyable, with happy agents receiving
the highest ratings. While positive emotions enhanced participants’ perceptions of the agents,
these did not translate into better learning outcomes, highlighting the complexity of emotional
influence in educational settings.
